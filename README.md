# Machine Learning Fundamentals

This repository contains my detailed notes on the fundamental concepts of machine learning, including:

- Linear Regression 
- Multivariate Regression 
- Logistic Regression 
- Classification 

## Background 

These notes were created as part of my studies in the Master of Science and Technology in Computer Science and Complex Systems Modeling program at [insert university name here]. They are meant to serve as a comprehensive guide to the basic concepts of machine learning.
